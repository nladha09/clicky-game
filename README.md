Finding Nemo Memory Game
------------------------
* Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.

    * The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. 
    * The user's score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

* Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the user can restart the game by clicking on an image.
